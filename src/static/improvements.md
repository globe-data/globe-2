# Analytics Events Code Review

## Overview

Review of `events.ts` focusing on type safety, code organization, and reduction of duplicated concerns.

## Current Strengths üëç

1. **Clear Type Hierarchy**

   - Well-structured `BaseEvent`
   - Proper inheritance patterns

2. **Comprehensive Validation**

   - Complete Zod schemas
   - Strong TypeScript integration

3. **Type Discrimination**

   - Effective use of TypeScript's type system
   - Clear event differentiation

4. **Organization**

   - Logical grouping of related events
   - Clean separation of concerns

5. **Field Management**

   - Proper optional field handling
   - Clear required vs optional distinction

6. **Architecture**
   - Clean separation between event types and request types
   - Well-structured exports

## Suggested Improvements ü§î

1. **Schema Organization**

   - Group related schemas into namespaces/modules:
     - UI events
     - System events
     - Performance events
   - Extract reusable sub-schemas (e.g., viewport dimensions)

2. **Type Safety Enhancements**

   - Add branded types for IDs
   - Strengthen validation for:
     - URLs
     - Timestamps
     - Formatted strings

3. **Documentation Needs**

   - Add JSDoc comments for event types
   - Include example payloads
   - Document validation rules/constraints

4. **Extensibility Considerations**

   - Add metadata field to BaseEvent
   - Implement schema versioning

5. **Constants Management**
   - Extract magic strings to constants
   - Define reusable validation rules

## Conclusion

The code is well-structured and type-safe. Suggested improvements focus on maintainability and documentation rather than critical issues.
